abstract="The discrete ordinate method for the transfer of monochromatic unpolarized radiation in non-isothermal, vertically inhomogeneous media, as implemented in the computer code Discrete-Ordinate-Method Radiative Transfer, DISORT, is reviewed. Both the theoretical background and its algorithmic implementation are covered. Among others, described are the reduction of the order of the standard algebraic eigenvalue problem to increase efficiency in both the homogenous and particular solutions of the system of coupled ordinary differential equations, application of the scaling transformation to make the solution unconditionally stable for arbitrary large values of optical depth, application of the $\delta$-M method to handle highly anisotropic scattering, the correction of intensities by the Nakajima-Tanaka method, and the implementation of a realistic bidirectional bottom boundary. Numerical considerations that make the implementation robust and efficient are also discussed. Examples of setting up DISORT runs are shown by using test cases with increasing complexity. Brief summaries of the versions released to date are provided, as well.",

abstract = {Co-Array Fortran represents a correspondence between tensor notation and an extended Fortran array syntax. It uses normal Fortran array indices to point to data in local memory and adds co-array indices to point to data in remote memory. By writing algorithms according to the rules of tensor algebra, the programmer can transcribe a parallel algorithm directly into co-array syntax and can experiment with alternative communication patterns with full confidence that the algorithm is correct. Data communication is transparent in the notation itself and the syntax allows compilers to exploit low-latency hardware so that application codes scale well to large numbers of processors. Co-array syntax, combined with the object-oriented features of Fortran 90, is a powerful tool for designing and writing parallel algorithms. It raises the level of abstraction with little or no loss of performance.}}

abstract = {Abstract A long-period numerical forecast is made with a two-level quasi-geostrophic model, starting with an atmosphere in relative rest. Both friction and non-adiabatic effects are included in the equations, the latter as a linear function of latitude. Principal empirical elements in the experiment are the intensity of the heating, the value of the vertical stability, and the type of frictional dissipation. The flow patterns which develop are quite realistic, including a jet and zonal surface westerlies in middle latitudes, and the growth of a large disturbance. The associated energy transformations are investigated, and demonstrate the important role of the disturbance in the development of the zonal currents. The meridional circulation is also studied, together with its contribution to the zonal momentum budgets of the lower and upper halves of the atmosphere. Truncation errors eventually put an end to the forecast by producing a large fictitious increase in energy.},
