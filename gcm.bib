abstract="The discrete ordinate method for the transfer of monochromatic unpolarized radiation in non-isothermal, vertically inhomogeneous media, as implemented in the computer code Discrete-Ordinate-Method Radiative Transfer, DISORT, is reviewed. Both the theoretical background and its algorithmic implementation are covered. Among others, described are the reduction of the order of the standard algebraic eigenvalue problem to increase efficiency in both the homogenous and particular solutions of the system of coupled ordinary differential equations, application of the scaling transformation to make the solution unconditionally stable for arbitrary large values of optical depth, application of the $\delta$-M method to handle highly anisotropic scattering, the correction of intensities by the Nakajima-Tanaka method, and the implementation of a realistic bidirectional bottom boundary. Numerical considerations that make the implementation robust and efficient are also discussed. Examples of setting up DISORT runs are shown by using test cases with increasing complexity. Brief summaries of the versions released to date are provided, as well.",
