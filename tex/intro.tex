\section{Structure of a General Circulation Model}

A simple general circulation model consists of a ``dynamical core'':
model the atmosphere as a Navier-Stokes fluid, the Earth as a rotating
sphere. This consists of three equations for the conservation of
momenta, another equation for the conservation of mass (for atmosphere),
and some thermodynamic equation of state for describing pressure as
related to density. Atmospheric general circulation models add equations
of radiative transfer to the dynamic core, and some physical
parametrizations for subgrid details.

We will first examine the atmosphere as a fluid. Since the atmosphere is
``so shallow'' and ``so slow'', we can make various approximations to
the Navier-Stokes equations to make it easier to solve.
But we will have six unknowns (the velocity vector of the atmosphere,
its density, pressure, and temperature) and only four equations from
fluid mechanics alone.

Fortunately, the atmosphere is amazingly close to an ideal gas. So we
can draw upon a rich thermodynamical well. This will be done in the
second section.

We can add more realism to our model than ``just atmosphere''. Doing so
requires care when structuring the code. The usual architecture has a
separate module for each model component, which interact with each other
via a ``coupler'' pattern --- a specific maestro which coordinates the
time-stepping.

Some discussion of radiative transfer will be given, where sunlight and
heat emitted from the Earth affect atmospheric temperatures. This is
where more than 90\% of CPU cycles are spent in climate models.

\section{Fluid Mechanics of Atmosphere}

\subsection{Navier-Stokes Equations}

The conservation of momenta amounts to Newton's second Law
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD\vec{u}}{\materialD t}
  =\frac{-1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu\nabla^{2}\vec{u} + \vec{F}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{u}$ is the velocity vector field for the atmosphere, $\rho$
its density, $p$ pressure, $\nu$ kinematics viscosity, and $\vec{F}$
external forces like gravity. Here we use the material derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD f}{\materialD t} = \partial_{t}f + (\vec{u}\cdot\grad)f
\end{equation}
which should match the intuition of, if $\vec{x}(t)$ is the position of
a parcel of atmospheric fluid at time $t$, taking the total time
derivative of $f(\vec{x}(t))$ where we note
$\partial_{t}\vec{x}(t)=\vec{u}(t)$.

The conservation of mass may be written in a variety of ways, usually as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD\rho}{\materialD t}+\rho\grad\cdot\vec{u}=0.
\end{equation}
The atmosphere typically doesn't have a constant density, so this can't
be simplified much further.

For the equation of state, we'll need to invoke thermodynamics.
Fortunately, the atmosphere is close enough to an ideal gas that we can
rely on quite a few results from the literature. The interested reader
may peruse Vallis~\cite{vallis_2017} or Holton and
Hakim~\cite{holton2013dynamicMeteorology} for details.

\subsection{In Rotating Reference Frame}

We can approximate the Earth as a rotating sphere. The angular velocity
vector $\vec{\Omega}$ is roughly constant, and points in the same
direction as the North pole. We relate the time derivative of quantities
as measured in the inertial frame $\D\vec{A}/\D t$ to how it appears to a
rotating reference frame $(\D\vec{A}/\D t)'$ (primes indicate quantities
in the rotating frame) by
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\D\vec{A}}{\D t} = \left(\frac{\D\vec{A}}{\D t}\right)' + \vec{\Omega}\times\vec{A}.
\end{equation}
When applies to the position $\vec{r}$ of a body, we find the velocity
in an inertial frame related to the velocity in a rotating frame
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\D\vec{r}}{\D t} = \left(\frac{\D\vec{r}}{\D t}\right)' + \vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}
\end{equation}
and acceleration in the rotating frame may be found from
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\D}{\D t}(\vec{v} - \vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r})
  = \frac{\D\vec{v}'}{\D t}+\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{v}'
\end{equation}
where $\vec{v} = \D\vec{r}/\D t$ and $\vec{v}' = (\D\vec{r}/\D t)'$.
After some algebra, we conclude
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\D\vec{v}'}{\D t}
  = \frac{\D \vec{v}}{\D t}
    - 2\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{v}'
    - \vec{\Omega}\times(\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r}).
\end{equation}
That is, we have to add the Coriolis effect
$-2\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{v}'$ and the centrifugal pseudoforce
$-\vec{\Omega}\times(\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{r})$. We usually sweep the
centrifugal contribution into the external force term.

The conservation of momentum equations in the rotating frame would
become
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD\vec{u}}{\materialD t} + 2\vec{\Omega}\times\vec{u}
  = \frac{-1}{\rho}\grad p + \vec{F}
\end{equation}
where we understand $\vec{u}$ refers to the fluid velocity for the
atmosphere as observed in the rotating frame.

\subsection{Spherical Coordinates in Rotating Frame}

We change coordinates to spherical coordinates, taking $\lambda$ to
describe the longitude (Eastwards angle), $\theta$ the latitude (angular
distance polewards), and $r$ the radial distance from the center of the
Earth. In these coordinates, any scalar quantity $\varphi$ has its
material derivative be
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD\varphi}{\materialD t}
  = \frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t}
    + \frac{u}{r\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial\lambda}
    + \frac{v}{r}\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial\theta}
    + w\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial r}.
\end{equation}
Care must be taken when computing the viscosity term, because the vector
Laplacian is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^{2}\vec{A} := \grad(\grad\cdot\vec{A}) - \curl(\curl\vec{A}).
\end{equation}
Only in Cartesian coordinates does it coincide with the familiar Laplacian.

\begin{prop}
  Mass conservation in spherical coordinates is
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}
    + \frac{1}{r\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial(u\rho)}{\partial\lambda}
    + \frac{1}{r\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}(v\rho\cos(\theta))
    + \frac{1}{r^{2}}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^{2}w\rho)
    = 0
  \end{equation}
  where we have $\lambda$ be the latitude coordinate, $\theta$ the
  longitude coordinate, $r$ the vertical/radial coordinate; and
  $\vec{u}=(u,v,w)$ is the velocity pointing North $u$, East $v$, and
  outward $w$.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  Momentum conservation in a rotating frame using spherical coordinates
  are (neglecting the viscosity term)
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
      \frac{\materialD u}{\materialD t} -\left(2\Omega + \frac{u}{r\cos(\theta)}\right)(v\sin(\theta)-w\cos(\theta))
      &= \frac{-1}{\rho r\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial p}{\partial\lambda}\\
      \frac{\materialD v}{\materialD t} +\left(2\Omega + \frac{u}{r\cos(\theta)}\right)u\sin(\theta)
      + \frac{wv}{r}
      &= \frac{-1}{\rho r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial\theta} \\
      \frac{\materialD w}{\materialD t} - \frac{u^{2}+v^{2}}{r} -
      2\Omega u\cos(\theta)
      &= \frac{-1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}-g.\label{eq:vertical-rotating-momentum-conservation}
    \end{align}
  \end{subequations}
  The quadratic terms on the left-hand side involving factors of $1/r$
  are usually called ``metric terms'', and those involving factors of
  $\Omega$ are Coriolis terms.
\end{prop}

Neglecting the viscosity term may be justified by observing, in MKS
units, it is typically $10^{-7}$ times smaller than the $\materialD\vec{u}/\materialD t$
term. For more on this, see Holton and
Hakim~\cite{holton2013dynamicMeteorology}, \S2.4 for scale analysis of
momentum equations.

\begin{prop}
  The radius of the Earth $a$ may be approximated as
  \begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
      a = \SI{20000/\pi}{\km}
  \end{equation}
  or, to some 44 digits
  \begin{equation}
    a\approx
    \SI{6366.1977236758134307553505349005744813783858}{\km}.%\,2962
  \end{equation}
  \end{subequations}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Recall from history, in 1791, the meter was defined such that a
  quarter of the Earth's circumference through the North and South
  poles, starting at the equator, would be
\begin{equation}
  (2\pi a)/4 = \SI{1e4}{\km}
\end{equation}
where $a$ is Earth's radius. Modern measurements note the meridional
circumference of the Earth is $\SI{40007.86}{\km}$, so this
historic definition has an absolute error of $\SI{7.86}{\km}$ (making
it a useful approximation). In reality, Earth's equatorial
radius $a_{eq}\approx \SI{6378.137}{\km}$ and polar radius
$a_{pol}\approx\SI{6356.752}{\km}$ have a geometric mean of
$\SI{6367.44}{\km}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
  The inverse of Earth's radius is
  \begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{a} = \frac{\pi}{\SI{2e4}{\km}}
  \end{equation}
  or, to 36 digits
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{a}\approx \SI{1.57079632679489661923132169163975144e-4}{\per\km}
  \end{equation}
  \end{subequations}
\end{cor}

This speeds up performance when doing calculations, since multiplication
is between 5- to 9-times faster than division on x86 CPUs\footnote{See, e.g.,
Wittmann and friends~\cite{wittmann2015short} or more informally \url{https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/}}.
Such is the proportion of CPU latency (i.e., the time from the start of
the instruction until the operation concludes).

\subsection{Primitive Equations}\label{subsec:intro:primitive-equations}

There are three simplifications we could make: the shallow fluid
approximation, the hydrostatic approximation, and the traditional
approximation.\footnote{My guide for this material is drawn
principally from Vallis~\cite[\S\S2.2.4--2.2.5]{vallis_2017}, who cites
Phillips~\cite{phillips1966TheEquationsofMotionforaShallowRotatingAtmosphereandtheTraditionalApproximation}
and White~\cite{white2002}.}

We usually simplify these equations further, noting that the height of
the atmosphere is no greater than $\SI{100}{\km}$ which is about
60-times smaller than the radius of the Earth. So we could think of the
atmosphere as a shallow fluid.\marginpar{(1) Shallow fluid: $r=a+z\approx a$,\\
  $\partial/\partial r=\partial/\partial z$}
That is to say, we treat $r=a+z$ where
$a$ is the radius of the Earth and $z\ll a$ the altitude. Consequently,
we replace $\partial/\partial r$ by $\partial/\partial z$ and all other
occurrences of $r$ by $a$. If we make this simplification, then we
are also forced to make the hydrostatic
approximation: in the vertical
momentum equation, the gravitational term is balanced by the pressure
gradient term (and these are the dominant terms in the equation, the
other terms are negligible in comparison). That is to say, we use\marginpar{(2)Hydrostatic Approximation}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}=-\rho g
\end{equation}
instead of Eq \eqref{eq:vertical-rotating-momentum-conservation}. These
two approximations are bundle deal --- they are taken together, or not
at all. For large-scale atmospheric (and oceanic) flow on Earth, they're
a pretty good approximation.

The traditional approximation\marginpar{(3) Traditional approximation} discards Coriolis terms in the horizonal
momentum equations, and the smaller metric terms $uw/r$ and
$vw/r$. This approximation is largely independent of the shallow fluid
and hydrostatic approximations, and may be empirically justified by
examining the scale of the various terms.

\begin{prop}[Momentum Equations]
Taking all three approximations gives us the conservation of momentum equations:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \frac{\materialD u}{\materialD t}
    - 2\Omega v\sin(\theta) - \frac{uv}{a}\tan(\theta)
    &= \frac{-1}{\rho a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial p}{\partial\lambda}\\
    \frac{\materialD v}{\materialD t}
    + 2\Omega u\sin(\theta) + \frac{u^{2}\tan(\theta)}{a}
    &= \frac{-1}{\rho a}\frac{\partial p}{\partial\theta} \\
    0 &= \frac{-1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}-g.
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{prop}

\begin{note}
In our approximations, we now have
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD}{\materialD t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t} +
  \frac{u}{a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda} +
  \frac{v}{a}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} + w\frac{\partial}{\partial z}.
\end{equation}
\end{note}

\begin{defn}
It is conventional to introduce the \define{Coriolis parameter}
\begin{equation}
  f = 2\Omega\sin(\theta)
\end{equation}
to simplify calculations. Empirically, $\Omega=7.2921150\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{rad}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
\end{defn}


\begin{prop}[Continuity Equation]
The mass conservation equation for a shallow atmosphere becomes
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}
  + \frac{u}{a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial\lambda}
  + \frac{v}{a}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial\theta}
  + w\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial z}
  + \rho\left(\frac{1}{a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\lambda}
              + \frac{1}{a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial(v\cos(\theta))}{\partial\theta}
              + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}
       \right)
  = 0
\end{equation}
or equivalently
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}
  + \frac{1}{a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial(u\rho)}{\partial\lambda}
  + \frac{1}{a\cos(\theta)}\frac{\partial(v\rho\cos(\theta))}{\partial\theta}
  + \frac{\partial(w\rho)}{\partial z}
  = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\section{Thermodynamics for Atmospheric Fluid}
We need some way to relate density to pressure, which requires
thermodynamics. Atmosphere is approximately an ideal gas, so we could
use
\begin{equation}
  p = \rho R T
\end{equation}
where $R=\SI{287}{\joule\per\kilogram\per\kelvin}$ is the gas
constant for dry air, $T$ is temperature (an unknown). We need another
equation to fix $T$. A first approximation simply fixes $T=T_{0}$ to be
constant, a second approximation fixes $T=T_{0}-T_{1}z$ or something
similar. But realistically, we want to model temperature from first
principles.

For a simple ideal gas, the heat capacity is constant, so
\begin{equation}
  I = cT
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant, and the internal energy of the fluid $I$
satisfies the fundamental thermodynamic relation
\begin{equation}
  \D I = T\,\D\eta - p\,\D\alpha + \mu\,\D S
\end{equation}
where $\alpha=1/\rho$ is the specific volume, $\eta$ is the specific
entropy, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $S$ is the composition of
the fluid in terms of ``species'' of molecules. If $\dot{Q}$ is the
heating applied to the fluid and $\dot{Q}_{E} = \dot{Q} + \mu\dot{S}$ is
the total rate of energy change, then the internal energy equation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\materialD I}{\materialD t} + \frac{p}{\rho}\grad\cdot\vec{u} = \dot{Q}_{E}
\end{equation}
or the entropy equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\materialD \eta}{\materialD t} = \frac{1}{T}\dot{Q}
\end{equation}
could be used to fix the remaining parameters, provided we have a
boundary condition giving us $\dot{Q}$ and $\dot{S}$. For an ideal dry
gas (like the atmosphere) we have
\begin{equation}
  \D I = c_{v}\,\D T
\end{equation}
which gives us
\begin{equation}
c_{v}\frac{\materialD T}{\materialD t} + p\alpha\grad\cdot\vec{u} = \dot{Q}.
\end{equation}
Arguably, for a steady state, $\dot{Q}=0$. Realistically, the Sun
\emph{is} an external heat source, and we need to model how it heats the
atmosphere, which is the rich subject of radiative transfer.

\begin{rmk}
  We can combine several results from thermodynamics to write the first
  law as
  \begin{equation}
    \dot{Q} = c_{p}\frac{\materialD T}{\materialD t} - \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\materialD p}{\materialD t}
  \end{equation}
  where for the atmosphere
  $c_{p}=1003\,\mathrm{J}\cdot\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and
  $\dot{Q}$ is the heat rate per unit mass. This is typically used in
  numerical weather prediction. See chapter 2 of
  Kalnay~\cite{kalnay_2002} but be warned: Kalnay uses $Q$ whereas we
  use $\dot{Q}$.
\end{rmk}

\section{Radiative Transfer}

We need to incorporate heating from sunlight, which requires radiative
transfer --- for a review, see Liou~\cite{liou2002introduction} and
Stamnes, Thomas, and Stamnes~\cite{stamnes_thomas_stamnes_2017}.
The latter are part of the team who coded the \DISORT/\index{\DISORT/}
library\footnote{\DISORT/ homepage \url{http://www.rtatmocn.com/disort/}},
which underpins many radiative transfer libraries like the
\RRTM/\index{\RRTM/} suite\footnote{\url{http://rtweb.aer.com/}}.

The basic radiative transfer equation is an integro-differential
equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integro-diff-radiative-transfer}
  \mu\frac{\D I(\tau,\mu,\phi)}{\D\tau}
  = I(\tau, \mu, \phi) - S(\tau, \mu, \phi)
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the optical depth of the medium; $I$ the diffuse
specific intensity in a cone of unit solid angle along direction $\mu$,
$\phi$; and $S$ is the ``source function''
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    S(\tau, \mu, \phi) &= Q^{\text{(beam)}}(\tau,\mu,\phi)  + Q^{\text{(therm)}}(\tau) \\
    &\qquad + \frac{\omega(\tau)}{4\pi}
  \int^{2\pi}_{0}\int^{1}_{-1} P(\tau,\mu,\phi;\mu',\phi')I(\tau,\mu',\phi')\,\D\phi'\,\D\mu'.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Here $\omega(\tau)$ is the ``single scattering albedo'' of the medium
(i.e., the fraction of an incident beam which is scattered by that
volume), and $P$ is the ``scattering phase function'' describing the
angular scattering pattern of an infinitesimal volume. The curious
reader may profitably read chapters 5--8 of Stamnes and
friends~\cite{stamnes_thomas_stamnes_2017}.

\begin{note}
Laszlo and friends~\cite{Laszlo2016} explain how \DISORT/ solves Eq
\eqref{eq:integro-diff-radiative-transfer} in three basic steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transform the equation into a set of radiative transfer equations
  by separation of azimuth dependence;
\item Transforming these equations into a system of ordinary
  differential equations;
\item Solving the System of ODEs using linear algebra.
\end{enumerate}
This strategy may be found in Chandrasekhar's book
\emph{Radiative Transfer} (1960) and refined over time.
\end{note}

\section{ADT Calculus}

Following scientific programming tradition from SAGA\footnote{\url{https://www.ii.uib.no/saga/index.html}},
Rouson and friends~\cite{rouson2011scientific,rouson2008grid}, and much
hard earned experience, we will be encoding mathematical equations
directly into the abstract data types.

Recall\footnote{E.g., from Olver~\cite{olver2014introduction} chapter 1,
section 1 [discussion under un-numbered section heading ``Classical
  Solutions'']} that we impose a partial differential equation upon a
domain. Taken together, a partial differential equation (or a system of
differential equations), some choice of boundary values or initial data,
and a specific domain form a \define{(Differential) Problem}.

\begin{rmk}[Importance of Domain]
Although this might seem pedantic, there's an important point here: a
differential equation described using jet bundles \emph{necessarily} has
a smooth bundle to describe the dependent variables and independent
variables. The latter being described using a manifold (or some other
``mostly smooth'' space). That is to say, we have $\pi\colon E\to B$ be
a bundle, $B$ a $k$-dimensional manifold describing the independent
variables. A system of differential equations is then an equalizer
on the jet bundle $j^{r}E$, which has many possible solutions. We
further need either initial data or boundary conditions to find a unique
solution. The space $B$ is usually weakened to be Lipschitz (or
something), and generically called a \emph{Domain}.
\end{rmk}

Given a differential problem, numerical analysts approximate it using
any number of schemes (finite differences, finite element, spectral
method, finite volume, etc.). This may require additional data --- a
choice of mesh, basis functions, approximation of differential
operators, and so on. Underlying all this lies a pre-existing implicit
choice of domain and equation(s). We bundle this together into a
\define{Problem} data structure\footnote{Unfortunately, the term
``class'' is overloaded in mathematics, and ambiguous in numerical
analysis as possibly referring to one of its meanings in mathematics
\emph{or possibly} its meaning in object-oriented programming. I'm going
to use the less ambiguous phrase ``data structure'' when possible for
clarity.}.

We abstract away the notion of mathematical functions as \define{Field}
objects (appealing to our physics intuition of a physical field). Since
these are approximations to the underlying mathematical gadget, we need
to specify its implementation of numerical schemes. Arguably, each
scheme requires different data (finite difference schemes encode a field
as a vector, finite element methods encode a field as a tuple of
coefficients on each ``element'', spectral methods require just a vector
of coefficients, and so on) and different algorithms for differentiation.
Consequently, the constructor of a field requires a problem object.

There are five or six fields in our equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3 from the components of the velocity vector field $\vec{u}$
\item 1 from the pressure $p$
\item 1 from the density $\rho$
\item possibly 1 from the temperature $T$.
\end{itemize}
For the atmosphere, we have a compressible fluid, and we can derive
equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3 equations from the conservation of momentum (involving
  $\vec{u}$, $p$, $\rho$)
\item 1 equation from the conservation of mass (involving $\vec{u}$, $\rho$)
\item 1 equation from the ideal gas law (involving $T$, $\rho$, $p$)
\item 1 equation from the first law of thermodynamics (involving $T$,
  $\vec{u}$, $p$, $\rho$).
\end{itemize}

Written in pseudocode, the goal is to have a ``{\tt field}'' data type
equipped with the differential operators as functions. For example, we
could have some code snippet like:

\begin{Verbatim}
field solve_heat_equation(number_of_steps, dt) =
    field temperature;
    initialize(temperature);
    do i=0,number_of_steps 
        temperature = integrate(temperature, dt)
    return(temperature)

// definition of integrate one time-step
field integrate(temperature, dt) =
    temperature = temperature + dt*diffusivity*laplacian(temperature)
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent%
The code's intent is clear.

\subsection{Finite Difference Schemes}
It is tempting to create a mesh by creating cells formed by discretizing
the latitudes $\lambda_{i} = i\pi/M$ and longitudes $\theta_{j}=j2\pi/N$
and create concentric spheres of radii $r_{k} = a + kh$ where
$i=0,1,\dots,M$, $j=0,1,\dots,N-1$ and $k=0,\dots,K$ (say, $K = \lceil\SI{100}{\kilo\meter}/h\rceil$).
But there is some freedom here not yet fixed: do we pick values of
variables at the center of the cells? On the boundary of the cells? Where?

The Arakawa--Lamb C grid (first introduced by Arakawa and Lamb~\cite{ARAKAWA1977173}), as depicted in
figure~\ref{fig:intro:arakawa-lamb-c-grid}, is the most popular in
practice. The atmospheric velocity vector components live on the center
of the boundary faces of each cell, whereas other scalar physical
quantities live at the center of each cell. We draw the cell bounded by
heights $r_{k}$ and $r_{k+1}$, and latitudes $\lambda_{i-1}$ and $\lambda_{i}$.

\begin{figure}[h]\label{fig:intro:arakawa-lamb-c-grid}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{img/arakawa-lamb-grid-0.mps}
  \caption{Arakawa--Lamb C grid, cross-section with constant longitude;
    the Earth is shaded in gray.}
\end{figure}

We can approximate the various derivatives using finite-difference
schemes. For example,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial\lambda}\approx \frac{T_{i+1,j,k}-T_{i,j,k}}{\Delta\lambda}
\end{equation}
for the forward-difference approximation of the latitude derivative of
temperature. This transforms the primitive equations (from subsection
\ref{subsec:intro:primitive-equations}) into a system of equations which
we can solve.

\subsection{Finite Volume Methods}
We should bear in mind that the volume of each cell varies with height,
and that quantities which \emph{should} be conserved are
\emph{not}. This motivates the finite volume method, which ensures
conserved quantities are genguinely conserved.
