Blah blah blah.

\section*{Compiler Considerations}

We'll be working with mostly \FORTRAN/ 2008-compliant code (or, more
precisely, some large subset of it). The compilers which work include,
but not limited to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item GNU's {\tt gfortran}
\item Intel {\tt ifort} compiler
\item IBM XL Fortran compiler
\item Cray Compiler
\item Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) fortran compiler
\end{enumerate}

\section*{License}

The code produced here is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.
