\chapter{Spectral Methods}

Following Durran~\cite{durran2010numerical}, we will discuss spectral
methods to solve differential equations. The intuition guiding these
methods should be thinking of a truncated Fourier series
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{N}(x) = \sum^{N}_{k=-N}c_{k}\E^{\I kx}
\end{equation}
then trying to find the coefficients $c_{k}$ such that they minimize
some error, or satisfy some system of equations. More generally, instead
of working with the basis functions $\exp(\I kx)$ we could use some
other basis: this is what spectral methods study.
